            <h2>Introduction to Universal Design</h2>
            <p>
                Universal Design is an approach to design that focuses on creating products, environments,
                and systems that are accessible and usable by people of all abilities, ages, and backgrounds.
                The goal is to eliminate barriers and ensure inclusivity in the design process.

            <h2>Key Principles of Universal Design</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Equitable Use:</strong> The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility in Use:</strong> The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Simple and Intuitive:</strong> Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.</li>

            <h2>A New Definition of Universal Design</h2>
            <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=II6VV5iAW9cC&oi=fnd&pg=PR11&dq=universal+design&ots=Z41U2xsyPp&sig=0qTOiFmdlg0JSYvNzSNlrRH1OWQ#v=onepage&q=universal%20design&f=false" class="cta-button">Link to Book From Google Scholar</a>
            <p>  According to a book published by Edward Steinfeld and Jodrana L. Maisel:
                "We have moved beyond the historical base and original delineation of universal design, which Ron Mace originally defined as the design of products and environments usable by all without the need for
                special accomodations." Steinfeild and Maisel propose a new definition:
                "A process that enables and empowers a diverse population by improving human performance, health and wellness and social participation."
