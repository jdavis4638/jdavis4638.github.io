                <h2>Introduction to Universal Design</h2>
                <p>
                    Universal Design is an approach to design that focuses on creating products, environments, and systems that are accessible and usable by people of all abilities, ages, and backgrounds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>"The goal is to eliminate barriers and ensure inclusivity in the design process."</strong>

                <h2>Understanding Accessibility</h2>
                <p>
                    We all know how frustrating it can be to use a website or application that, for whatever reason, just doesn't work. Have you experienced that with a website you've used lately? Think about it, and let that feeling sink in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>"This is the experience that millions of people with disabilities feel every day when using their computers."</strong>

            <section>             <h2>A New Definition of Universal Design</h2>
                <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=II6VV5iAW9cC&oi=fnd&pg=PR11&dq=universal+design&ots=Z41U2xsyPp&sig=0qTOiFmdlg0JSYvNzSNlrRH1OWQ#v=onepage&q=universal%20design&f=false" class="cta-button">Link to Book From Google Scholar</a>
                <p>According to a book published by Edward Steinfeld and Jodrana L. Maisel:</p>
                <p>
                    "We have moved beyond the historical base and original delineation of universal design, which Ron Mace originally defined as the design of products and environments usable by all without the need for special accommodations." Steinfeild and Maisel propose a new definition:
                    <strong>"A process that enables and empowers a diverse population by improving human performance, health and wellness and social participation."</strong>
                </p>  </section>
            <section>
                <h2>The Intent</h2>
                <p>
                   The intent for universal design is to simplify life for everyone by making products, communications, and the built environment more usable by as many people as possible at little or no extra cost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong> "Universal design benefits people of all ages and abilities."</strong>

            <h2>Types of Impairment to Consider in Design</h2>

            <article>
                <h3>Visual impairment</h3>
                <p>This can range from complete blindness, to low vision, to color blindness.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Mobility or dexterity impairment</h3>
                <p>People may face more severe mobility challenges such as paraplegia/quadriplegia, cerebral palsy, or multiple sclerosis, or they may have difficulty with fine motor control due to arthritis, Parkinson's disease, or simply old age.</p>

                <p>Someone who has total or partial hearing loss may have great difficulty accessing the content on specific types of websites.</p>

                <h3>Cognitive impairment</h3>
                <p>This is the least well-understood issue in web accessibility, ranging from severe learning disabilities to low literacy or numeracy skills, dyslexia, and cultural and language differences.</p>

            <h2>Accessible Design</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>"If accessible design is the process of creating objects, physical spaces and digital media that are accessible and easy to use for people with disabilities, then universal design is the practice that embraces the idea that designing for accessibility really entails providing better design for everyone. The focus in accessible design tends to be on people with disabilities whereas the focus in universal design is on everyone with a full spectrum of ability."</strong>
