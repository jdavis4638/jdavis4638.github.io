        <p style = "text-align: center; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
            <strong>The intent of universal design </strong> is to simplify life for everyone by making products, communications, and the built environment more usable by as many people as possible at little or no extra cost. Universal design benefits people of all ages and abilities.

                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Equitable Use</h2>
                <div class="center-container">
                    <img src="img/wheelchairparap.png" alt="man-in-wheelchair">
                </div>
                <p style="text-align: center;">“The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.”</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>High Contrast: </strong>Having high contrast helps both users with impaired vision and those in an environment with direct sunlight.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Text Equivalents (aka. Alt text):</strong> Assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers, screen magnifiers, text to speech, voice interfaces) rely on alt text, but text equivalents also help users on slow or unstable connections and act as a fallback if the image path is broken.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Mouse-Only Interactions: </strong>Hiding information behind a mouse-only interaction (like hover or double-click) makes it impossible to access for many users. The majority of Web traffic comes from devices without pointers (i.e., smartphones, tablets), which change the interaction ‘abilities’ of your users regardless of their personal physical state.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>As the name implies, the first principle is simply about providing an equal way for your users to access features and information. Avoid segregating any group of people because of personal restrictions and/or device capabilities.</p>

                    <img src="img/flexibility.avif" alt="woman-being-flexible">
                </div>
                <p style="text-align: center;">“The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.”</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scroll Hijacking:</strong> When you take control of ‘how’ a user naturally expects to scroll up/down a page, they may not have time to take everything in. This can get frustrating, causing them to leave.</li>
                    <li><strong>Text Resizing: </strong> Allow for the sizing up and down of text in your layouts. A simple browser or OS text adjustment shouldn’t ruin your beautifully crafted application.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This is largely about giving users a choice on how and when they access features, rather than forcing them into places they don’t want to be. 
                    Have enough flexibility in your solutions for user adaptations and they will have a more pleasant experience. Everyone enjoys a touch of personal customization.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Simple and Intuitive</h2>
                <div class="center-container">
                    <img src="img/light.avif" alt="hanging-lamp">
                </div>
                <p style="text-align: center;">“Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.”</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Good design is often defined as being intuitive to the user and the simpler the design is, the more likely users are to achieve their goals. Unfortunately, this is easier said than done.</li>
                    <li>Before you can design something “intuitive”, you have to figure out what your users know, expect, and do, in order for the interface to correctly anticipate and respond to their actions in a way that feels natural, logical, and pleasant.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Perceptible Information</h2>
                <div class="center-container">
                    <img src="img/communication.avif" alt="hearing-aid">
                </div>
                <p style="text-align: center;">“The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities.”</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Information Organization: </strong> Besides having adequate text contrast and sizing, breaking your information down into bite-sized pieces will make your content more accessible. Specifically, things like using subheadings in a long text post will make speed reading and skimming more effective.</li>
                    <li><strong>Graphics: </strong>A graphic to emphasize a point you’re making in text helps more visual users (and can convince a skimmer to slow down and read more closely).</li>
                    <li><strong>Charts and Graphs: </strong> Supplying both graph and table views of data allows users not only the flexibility to choose how to get information (#2 Flexibility in Use), but can also help make patterns in the data more discernible.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Tolerance for Error</h2>
                <div class="center-container">
                    <img src="img/phone.avif" alt="iphone">
                </div>
                <p style="text-align: center;">“The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.”</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Avoid Accidents: </strong> Account for these inevitabilities by putting permanent functions inside menus and/or behind “are you sure?” confirmation prompts. This makes them harder (practically impossible) to accidentally execute</li>
                    <li><strong>Allow for Undo: </strong> An alternative to prompting users all the time is to give them an “undo” option, or a way to dig into archives to retrieve old items.</li>
                </ul>

            <section>
                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Low Physical Effort</h2>
                <div class="center-container">
                    <img src="img/disabledusercomputer.avif" alt="disabled-user-on-pc">
                </div>
                <p style="text-align: center;">“The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue.”</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Action Grouping: </strong> Group actions together in specific areas of the screen. This minimizes the amount of mouse dragging or thumb stretching needed, which is helpful for anyone. It is especially helpful for users with either very large screens, or for users who have super-zoomed into their operating system and have to scroll through interfaces that would normally fit on a “default” screen.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Minimize Requests: </strong> Don’t require users to fill out lengthy forms or jump through multiple ‘hoops’ to gain access to their goal (e.g., account creation, a trial period of your application, a sample of a new book etc.). The less effort you require, the more involvement you’ll get.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Size and Space for Approach and Use</h2>
                <div class="center-container">
                    <img src="img/parkbench.png" alt="park-bench">
                </div>
                <p style="text-align: center;">“Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user's body size, posture, or mobility.”</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Action Targets: </strong>Take into account varying hand size and dexterity, especially for one-handed mobile device use. Make action targets large enough to click or tap easily, and put your primary actions within easy reach.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Posture: </strong>Some users are walking down the street, laying in bed, or doing other things that may make their reach a challenge. We can’t assume all users are sitting in a chair, at a desk, with a keyboard and mouse.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Dynamic Spaces: </strong>Virtual keyboards (and other accessibility tools) cover part of the screen. Keep dynamic space usage in mind through all states of onscreen keyboards, dropdown menus, etc. to avoid causing the user to block their own work.
                    </li>
                </ul>
