                <p style="text-align: center;">“The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.”</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>High Contrast: </strong>Having high contrast helps both users with impaired vision and those in an environment with direct sunlight.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Text Equivalents (aka. Alt text):</strong> Assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers, screen magnifiers, text to speech, voice interfaces) rely on alt text, but text equivalents also help users on slow or unstable connections and act as a fallback if the image path is broken.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Mouse-Only Interactions: </strong>Hiding information behind a mouse-only interaction (like hover or double-click) makes it impossible to access for many users. The majority of Web traffic comes from devices without pointers (i.e., smartphones, tablets), which change the interaction ‘abilities’ of your users regardless of their personal physical state.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>As the name implies, the first principle is simply about providing an equal way for your users to access features and information. Avoid segregating any group of people because of personal restrictions and/or device capabilities.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scroll Hijacking:</strong> When you take control of ‘how’ a user naturally expects to scroll up/down a page, they may not have time to take everything in. This can get frustrating, causing them to leave.</li>
                    <li><strong>Text Resizing: </strong> Allow for the sizing up and down of text in your layouts. A simple browser or OS text adjustment shouldn’t ruin your beautifully crafted application.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This is largely about giving users a choice on how and when they access features, rather than forcing them into places they don’t want to be. 
                    Have enough flexibility in your solutions for user adaptations and they will have a more pleasant experience. Everyone enjoys a touch of personal customization.</p>

                    <img src="img/light.avif" alt="hanging-lamp">
                </div>
                <p style="text-align: center;">“Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.”</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Good design is often defined as being intuitive to the user and the simpler the design is, the more likely users are to achieve their goals. Unfortunately, this is easier said than done.</li>
                    <li>Before you can design something “intuitive”, you have to figure out what your users know, expect, and do, in order for the interface to correctly anticipate and respond to their actions in a way that feels natural, logical, and pleasant.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Information Organization: </strong> Besides having adequate text contrast and sizing, breaking your information down into bite-sized pieces will make your content more accessible. Specifically, things like using subheadings in a long text post will make speed reading and skimming more effective.</li>
                    <li><strong>Graphics: </strong>A graphic to emphasize a point you’re making in text helps more visual users (and can convince a skimmer to slow down and read more closely).</li>
                    <li><strong>Charts and Graphs: </strong> Supplying both graph and table views of data allows users not only the flexibility to choose how to get information (#2 Flexibility in Use), but can also help make patterns in the data more discernible.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Avoid Accidents: </strong> Account for these inevitabilities by putting permanent functions inside menus and/or behind “are you sure?” confirmation prompts. This makes them harder (practically impossible) to accidentally execute</li>
                    <li><strong>Allow for Undo: </strong> An alternative to prompting users all the time is to give them an “undo” option, or a way to dig into archives to retrieve old items.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Action Grouping: </strong> Group actions together in specific areas of the screen. This minimizes the amount of mouse dragging or thumb stretching needed, which is helpful for anyone. It is especially helpful for users with either very large screens, or for users who have super-zoomed into their operating system and have to scroll through interfaces that would normally fit on a “default” screen.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Minimize Requests: </strong> Don’t require users to fill out lengthy forms or jump through multiple ‘hoops’ to gain access to their goal (e.g., account creation, a trial period of your application, a sample of a new book etc.). The less effort you require, the more involvement you’ll get.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Action Targets: </strong>Take into account varying hand size and dexterity, especially for one-handed mobile device use. Make action targets large enough to click or tap easily, and put your primary actions within easy reach.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Posture: </strong>Some users are walking down the street, laying in bed, or doing other things that may make their reach a challenge. We can’t assume all users are sitting in a chair, at a desk, with a keyboard and mouse.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Dynamic Spaces: </strong>Virtual keyboards (and other accessibility tools) cover part of the screen. Keep dynamic space usage in mind through all states of onscreen keyboards, dropdown menus, etc. to avoid causing the user to block their own work.
                    </li>

            <h2>Accessible Web Design </h2>
            
                <h3>Format</h3>
                <p>Use a standard page template. Don't assume that what you see is what other users will see; websites are
                    rendered differently depending on the device, browser, monitor size, resolution, and font settings. Logos,
                    menus, and navigation features should be standardized and predictable. Visitors should always know
                    where they are on the site and be able to easily retrace their steps or return to the home page.</p>
                <h3>Fonts</h3>
                <p>
                    Use the default or common fonts that work well for web display, such as Arial, Georgia, or Verdana.
                    Displayed font size is affected by monitor size and screen resolution, as well as the browser's settings. It is
                    better to use relative instead of absolute font sizes. If using absolute, minimum font size should be 10 on
                    a PC or 12 on a Mac. Use a different font for navigation than content, but don't use more than two font
                    types per website.
                </p>
                <h3>Color</h3>
                <p>
                    Use high contrasting background and text color, preferably light background and dark text. Avoid
                    backgrounds that obscure the text. Use a 256-color palette, which is standardized across all browsers and
                    platforms. Colors should be specified for all elements or none; if none are specified, the site will default to
                    the visitor's settings. Specifying only some colors can result in inconsistent formatting throughout the site. 
                </p>

                <h2>What Goes on the Page</h2>
                    <h3>Images</h3>
                    <p>Use alternative descriptive text (alt tags) to describe the content or function of every substantive image.
                        This is critical for the visually impaired, but it's also important for search engine optimization and cases
                        when browser images are disabled. Avoid using images as text or links. </p>
                    <h3>Tables</h3>
                    <p>
                        Specify the table and cell width in percentages rather than absolute pixels. Rows should shrink or expand
                        to fit a screen size. Fixed width rows and increased font sizes may result in horizontal scrolling on small
                        screens.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Links</h3>
                    <p>
                        Use descriptive anchor text rather than "click here." Use the pipe character | to separate consecutive
                        links. Do not use images as links because it is difficult to tell that they are clickable. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>Video and Audio</h2>
                        <h3>Transcripts</h3>
                        <p>Transcripts are an important part of video and audio accessibility because they provide a textual version
                            of the content that can be accessed by anyone. Transcripts are valuable to both deaf and blind users. Deaf
                            users can read the transcript, while blind users can digest a transcript with a refreshable braille reader or
                            screen reader. For web video, both captions and a text transcript should be provided. For content that is
                            audio only, a transcript is sufficient.</p>
                        <h3>Captions</h3>
                        <p>
                            Captions are time-synchronized text that can be read while watching a video. Captions assume that the
                            viewer is completely deaf and include all spoken content as well as non-speech elements, such as sound
                            effects and speaker identification. Captions differ from subtitles, which presume a viewer can hear, but
                            can't understand the language. For web video, closed captions are favored over open captions because
                            they can be toggled on and off in a video player. Web video captions are typically displayed in two lines at
                            the bottom of the screen, which is called a caption frame. Captioning can be done in real time, often
                            referred to as CART (Communication Access Real-Time Translation), or in post-production, sometimes
                            referred to as offline captioning
                        </p>
                        <h3>Audio Description</h3>
                        <p>
                            Audio description is an audio track that describes what is happening visually in the video. While blind
                            users are able to hear the spoken content, they aren't able to see demonstrations or diagrams. In
                            education, missing out on these references can stall the learning process. If a web video is developed with
                            accessibility in mind, it may be possible to avoid the need for audio description by describing the visual
                            actions as part of the main audio.
