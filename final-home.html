            <h2>James Rath's Story</h2>
            
                <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>"My whole outlook on life changed after I got my first Mac," Rath told CNNMoney.</strong>
                <p>The following is an excerpt from cnn.com: Apple Saved My Life. Born legally blind, the 20-year-old Rath says he was severely bullied as a child and had difficulty learning. He attempted suicide when he was 11 years old, and was diagnosed with depression at the same age.</p>

                    <p>Born legally blind, the 20-year-old Rath says he was severely bullied as a child and had difficulty learning. He attempted suicide when he was 11 years old, and was diagnosed with depression at the same age. </p>
                    <p>But when he got his first MacBook Pro on his 14th birthday, he found that the computer's accessibility features allowed him to see things he otherwise wouldn't have been able to see. He could read his schoolbooks and zoom in on software that allowed him to edit video.
                    he emotional four-minute film details Rath's early struggles with visual impairment. He suffers from two conditions: Ocular albinism, which gives him blurry vision, and nystagmus, which makes his eyes shake uncontrollably.
                    </p>
                    <p> His school provided him with a slew of tools to help him in class, including blowing up his texts using a photocopier. He said those visual aids were unwieldy, and led to some harsh bullying.</p>
                   <p>                   On his 14th birthday, his parents took him to the mall to get a present. They wandered into an Apple (AAPL) store, and Rath said a specialist introduced him to the zoom and VoiceOver features on Mac OS X, which allow the visually impaired to see and hear what's on the screen.
                </p>
                    <p>His parents bought him a MacPro, and it had a profound affect on his confidence.</p>
                    
                    <p>"I rapidly got out of my depression," Rath said. "It happened pretty quickly."</p>
                    <p>                    Rath said he had been interested in filmmaking since he was eight, when he started playing around with his parents' camcorder. He was amazed by the zoom function, which allowed him to see objects he was never able to see before.
                    </p>
                    <p>He became a very early YouTuber, posting videos starting in 2006. During his depression, he dropped filmmaking for a while. But he got back into it after getting his Mac.</p>

                    <img src="img/fact-1.png" alt="Globe">
                    <p>There are 285 million blind & vision impaired people in the world. They all have amazing gifts to contribute to society, but they need the right tools to realize their dreams.</p>

                    <img src="img/fact-2.png" alt="Key">
                    <p>Technology opens up so many doors. But for those without sight, computers don’t work straight out of the box. Software called a “screen reader” is needed to translate visual information verbally, so users can make sense of what is on the screen.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Solutions Exist</h3>
                    <img src="img/fact-4.png" alt="Checkmark">
                    <p>Thankfully, there are solutions for those who are visually impaired. Screen readers such as NVDA, as well as MAC's screenreading software built in, allow any user to access the internet. Importantly, these tools need to be understood by developers for others to get the most use out of them.</p>
