                <h3>"My whole outlook on life changed after I got my first Mac," Rath told CNNMoney. "I stopped doubting myself." </h3>
            <p>The following is an excerpt from cnn.com: Apple Saved My Life.
                Born legally blind, the 20-year-old Rath says he was severely bullied as a child and had difficulty learning. He attempted suicide when he was 11 years old, and was diagnosed with depression at the same age.
        
                But when he got his first MacBook Pro on his 14th birthday, he found that the computer's accessibility features allowed him to see things he otherwise wouldn't have been able to see. He could read his schoolbooks and zoom in on software that allowed him to edit video.
